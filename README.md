# She Codes Plus - Python Weather Project
Everyday we collect data about the weather in order to predict the forecast for the coming days. The problem
is that this data is never in a human readable format, thatâ€™s where you come in! Your task is to process csv files
containing data about the weather, and convert them into meaningful text-based summaries.

Run the file run_tests.py to see if all of the tests pass.
